This is repository for my Master's thesis work "Delay signal generator".
Main purpose of this device is to generate delayed signals from reference signal with RMS jitter less than 150 ps and maximum delay 10us. 
Device has 2 modes: coarse and fine mode. Coarse mode is just simple delay from counters (100MHz clock) and fine mode.
The most work was done for fine mode, since this was the most difficult task. 
You can read my paper about this work in papers repository.
